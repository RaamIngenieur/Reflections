When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I'd want to use a remote repository when I want to colloborate with other people working on other computers. I will also choose to use the remote repository when i want to work on multiple computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I will want to choose when to sync the changes made by others working on the project. Hence it would be better for me to choose when to pull rather than it happening automatically.
